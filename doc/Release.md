The Release Process
===================

We manage its releases through features and time-based models.

- A new patch version comes out every month when you made backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- A new minor version comes every six months when we added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- A new major version comes every year when we make incompatible API changes.

The meaning of "patch" "minor" and "major" comes from the Semantic [Versioning strategy](http://semver.org/).

This release process applies from version 1.0.x.

### Backwards Compatibility

We allow developers to upgrade with confidence from one minor version to the next one.

Whenever keeping backward compatibility is not possible, the feature, the enhancement or the bug fix will be scheduled for the next major version.
